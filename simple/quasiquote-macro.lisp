(cl:in-package #:clicl-reader)

;;; As recommended by the HyperSpec, the backquote and comma reader
;;; macros generate a data structure that corresponds to the one used
;;; in Scheme, i.e. containing the forms (QUASIQUOTE <form>),
;;; (UNQUOTE <form>), and (UNQUOTE-SPLICING <form>).
;;;
;;; These forms are converted to standard Common Lisp forms
;;; containing APPEND, LIST, QUOTE, APPLY, and VECTOR. 
;;;
;;; Our implementation is an almost immediate translation of section
;;; 2.4.6 of the Hyperspec.  Where the HyperSpec uses brackets [FORM],
;;; we use (TRANSFORM FORM).  The other difference is that the
;;; HyperSpec converts a form such as `(x1 x2 ... xn . atom) directly
;;; to (append [x1] [x2] ... [xn] (quote atom)), whereas we do it
;;; indirectly by calling TRANSFORM-COMPOUND on the (potentially
;;; dottet) list.
